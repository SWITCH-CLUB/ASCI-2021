## About Project

In this project we are planning to create a website for an imaginary Real Estate Company. In that website, there would be a section that would predict prices of houses.
 We would ask the user to input some features such as how much area of land he/she needs, the number of rooms he/she wants in his/her house etc.

We would take those features and predict the prices of house through an ML Model, and once any user get's the predicted price of the house we would store all its values in our backend and that would
 be feeded to our chatbot which would then interact with the user and would give them different locations of houses for the user to buy. As well as if the user has any questions regarding the property that would be answered by the chatbot.

The main aim of adding chatbot feature to our website would be to communicate with the user and convince them to buy house from our company.
