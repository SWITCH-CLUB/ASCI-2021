Lost and found system is a MERN stack web app and one stop destination for the lost/found item issue. Loosing any own item could be hurtful and and at times it becomes very difficult to aware your college mates about your problem. Same problem is with someone finding an item but not sure to whom it belongs to. This problem is practical and realistic. This web app will help to find the right user by pushing a notification whenever an item is listed and by necessary authentication it saves from misuse of information.
